<section>
  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Increasingly, we encourage authors to transition their sites and applications
  away from insecure transport, and onto encrypted and authenticated connections
  [[WEB-HTTPS]]. While this migration has significant advantages for both
  authors and users, it isn't without negative side-effects.

  Most notably, mixed content checking [[MIX]] has the potential to cause real
  headache for administrators tasked with moving substantial amounts of legacy
  content onto HTTPS. In particular, going through old content and rewriting
  subresource URLs manually is a huge undertaking. Moreover, it's often the case
  that truly legacy content is difficult or impossible to update. Consider the
  BBC's archived websites [[BBC-ARCHIVE]], or the New York Times' hard-coded
  URLs [[NYT-HTTPS]].

  We should remove this burden from site authors by allowing them to assert to a
  user agent that they intend a site to load only secure resources, and that
  insecure URLs ought to be treated as though they had been replaced with secure
  URLs.

  This document defines a new Content Security Policy directive,
  <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code>, through which authors can make
  this assertion.
  Note: Delivering the policy as a header allows an administrator to easily
  opt a set of pages into the upgrade mechanism without touching their source
  code individually. The legacy content examples above would not be feasible
  with an approach that inlined the policy into HTML, for example.

  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

  The overarching goal is to reduce the burden of migrating websites from
  <a><i lang="la">a priori</i> insecure origins</a> by reducing the negative
  side effects of mixed content blocking [[MIX]]. 
  
  If we assume that authors do the server-side legwork (obtaining a certificate,
  configuring the server, setting up redirects), and that authors also ensure
  that content is accessible at <em>the same {{URL/host}} and {{URL/path}}</em>
  on a secure {{URL/scheme}}, then the following statements ought to hold after
  implementing this feature:

  <ol>
    <li>
      Authors should be able to ensure that all content requested by a given
      page loads successfully, and securely. Mixed content blocking should not
      break pages as a result of migrating to a secure origin.

      Note: This requirement is <em>not</em> met by Mixed Content's <a>strict
      mode</a>, which makes something like the opposite assertion.
    </li>
    <li>
      As a result of #1, the user agent should not degrade any security
      indicators related to requesting mixed content, as no insecure content
      should be requested.
    </li>
    <li>
      Authors should be able to ensure that all inter-site links correctly send
      users to the site's secure address, and not to it's pre-migration insecure
      address.
    </li>
    <li>
      Authors should be able to achieve all these goals without editing a site's
      content. This is particularly important for archived content and legacy
      systems for which maintenance is difficult enough, never mind upgrades.
    </li>
    <li>
      Authors should be able to persue a gradual transition from insecure to
      secure, serving secure resources to clients that support upgrades, while
      retaining insecure resources for clients that don't.
    </li>
  </ol>

  Note: The mechanism defined here does <em>not</em> intend to supplant Strict
  Transport Security [[RFC6797]]. See [[#relation-to-hsts]] for details.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <div class="example">
    Megacorp, Inc. wishes to migrate <code>http://example.com/</code> to
    <code>https://example.com</code>. They set up the server-side requirements
    to make their own resources available over HTTPS, and work with partners in
    order to make third-party widgets available as well.

    They quickly realize, however, that the majority of their long-tail content
    is locked up in a database tied to an old content management system that
    they've been avoiding for years ("If it ain't broke..."). They'll need to
    spend quite a bit of time either migrating the content to their new system,
    or modifying it in-place in the old system. Either way, it ends up being a
    substantial amount of work, and though they put top programmers on the task,
    it clearly won't be done any time soon.

    As a stopgap measure, Megacorp injects the following header into every
    response that goes out through their servers:

    <pre>
      Content-Security-Policy: <a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a>
    </pre>

    This automatically upgrades all insecure resource requests for their pages
    to secure variants, allowing a user agent to treat the following HTML code:

    <pre>
      &lt;img src="http://example.com/image.png"&gt;
    </pre>

    as though it had been delivered as:

    <pre>
      &lt;img src="https://example.com/image.png"&gt;
    </pre>

    The URL will be rewritten before the request is made, meaning that no
    insecure requests will hit the network. Users will be safer, and Megacorp's
    administrators will be happier.
  </div>

  ISSUE: How does Megacorp know that it can safely redirect a client to a secure
  origin? Perhaps we ought to send a hint that the UA supports upgrades along
  with any {{Request}} whose {{Request/context-frame-type}} is
  <code>top-level</code>, <code>ancilliary</code>, or <code>nested</code>.
  Something like <code>Accept-Upgrade: https</code>, perhaps?

  <h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading Insecure Resource Requests</h2>

  In order to allow authors to mitigate the negative side-effects of migration
  away from <a><i lang="la">a priori</i> insecure origins</a>, authors may
  instruct the user agent to transparently upgrade resource requests to
  <a>potentially secure</a> variants of the original request's URL.

  To support this instruction, <a>environment settings objects</a> and
  <a>browsing contexts</a> have an <dfn>upgrade insecure resource requests
  flag</dfn> which is set to <code>No Upgrade</code> unless otherwise specified.
  This flag is checked in [[#upgrade-request]] in order to determine whether or
  not resource requests should be upgraded during <a>Fetching</a>.

  <h3 id="delivery">Upgrade Policy Delivery</h3>

  A server MAY instruct a user agent to upgrade insecure resource requests for
  a particular <a>protected resource</a> by sending a
  <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header [[!CSP]] that contains a
  <dfn>upgrade-insecure-requests</dfn> directive, defined via the following ABNF
  grammar:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "upgrade-insecure-requests"
    directive-value = ""
  </pre>

  When <a>enforcing</a> the <code>upgrade-insecure-requests</code> directive,
  set the <a>protected resource</a>'s <a>incumbent settings object</a>'s
  <a>upgrade insecure resource requests flag</a> to <code>Enforced
  Upgrade</code>.

  When <a>monitoring</a> the <code>upgrade-insecure-requests</code> directive,
  set the <a>protected resource</a>'s <a>incumbent settings object</a>'s
  <a>upgrade insecure resource requests flag</a> to <code>Monitored
  Upgrade</code>.

  ISSUE: In <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2015Feb/0042.html">a thread on public-webappsec@</a>,
  Peter Eckersley suggested modifying this to allow whitelisting specific hosts,
  rather than upgrading everything: "That way, if you have N third parties
  on a site, and (say) two of them provide images only, and don't support
  HTTPS at all, you can use the upgrade mechanism for scripts on the other
  N - 2 origins."

  <div class="example">
    For example, sending the following header with a document will ensure that
    subresource requests are upgraded, and that reports are sent out for each
    upgrade:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: <a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a>;
                               report-uri /upgrade-endpoint
    </pre>

    Sending the following header will not upgrade requests, but will send
    reports:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</a>: <a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a>;
                                           report-uri /upgrade-endpoint
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h3 id="feature-detect">Feature Detecting Clients Capable of Upgrading</h3>

  If a site requires the upgrade mechanism described in this document in order
  to provide users with a reasonable experience over secure transit, then
  authors need to determine whether or not it is safe to redirect a client to
  the secure version of a site. Rather than relying on user-agent sniffing to
  make this decision, user agents MUST advertise their capabilities when
  making insecure navigational requests by sending a <code>Prefer</code> HTTP
  request header expressing the desire for a secure representation [[!RFC7240]]
  as described in [[#preference]].

  <h4 id="preference">
    The <code>return=secure-representation</code> Preference
  </h4>

  The "<code><dfn>return=secure-representation</dfn></code>" preference
  indicates that the client prefers that the server redirect from an insecure
  resource representation to a secure one, and that it can successfully handle
  the <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> directive in order to make
  that redirection as seamless as possible.

  This new preference changes the <code><a>return</a></code> ABNF defined in
  <a lt="return">RFC7240 Section 4.2</a> to the following:

  <pre>
    return = "return" BWS "=" BWS ( "<dfn>secure-representation</dfn>" / "representation" / "minimal" )
  </pre>

  When a server encounters this preference in an HTTP request's headers, it
  SHOULD redirect the user to a secure version of the resource being requested.

  User agent implementation details are described in step #2 of the the
  [[#upgrade-request]] algorithm. Note in particular that to mitigate the risk
  that this header will become a vestigial part of the platform, user agents
  SHOULD omit the preference when making requests to <a>potentially secure
  origins</a>.

  <h3 id="nesting">Policy Inheritance</h3>

  If a {{Document}}'s <a>incumbent settings object</a>'s <a>upgrade insecure
  resource requests flag</a> is set to <code>true</code>, the user agent MUST
  ensure that all <a>nested browsing contexts</a> inherit the setting in the
  following ways:

  <ol>
    <li>
      When a <a>nested browsing context</a> <var>context</var> is created, set
      its <a>upgrade insecure resource requests flag</a> to <code>true</code> if
      <var>context</var>'s <a>embedding document</a>'s <a>upgrade insecure
      resource requests flag</a> is set to <code>true</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      When <a>creating a new <code>Document</code> object</a>, set its
      <a>incumbent settings object</a>'s <a>upgrade insecure resource requests
      flag</a> to <code>true</code> if its <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>upgrade
      insecure resource requests flag</a> is <code>true</code>.
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>

<!-- Big Text: Algorithms -->
<section>
  <h2 id="algorithms">Processing Algorithms</h2>

  <h3 id="upgrade-request">
    Upgrade <var>request</var> to a potentially secure URL, if appropriate
  </h3>

  Given a {{Request}} <var>request</var>, this algorithm will rewrite its
  {{Request/url}} if the {{Request/client}} from which the request originates
  has opted-in to upgrades. It will also inject a
  <code><a>return=secure-representation</a></code> preference for insecure
  navigational requests in order to improve a server's ability to feature-detect
  a client's upgrade capabilities.

  We will not upgrade cross-origin navigational requests, with the exception of
  form submissions. Form submissions will be upgraded to mitigate the risk of
  data leakage via plaintext submissions.

  ISSUE: This should be called from Fetch, probably after the existing step #3.

  <ol>
    <li>
      If <var>request</var>'s {{Request/url}} is <a>potentially secure</a>:
      return without modifying <var>request</var>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <var>request</var>'s {{Request/context-frame-type}} is
      <code>top-level</code>, <code>nested</code>, or <code>auxiliary</code>,
      then <a>append</a> a header named <code>Prefer</code> with a value
      of <code><a>return=secure-representation</a></code> to
      <var>request</var>'s {{Request/header-list}}.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <var>request</var>'s {{Request/context-frame-type}} is
      <code>top-level</code> or <code>auxiliary</code>, then:
     
      <ol>
        <li>
          If <var>request</var>'s {{Request/context}} is <code>form</code>,
          skip the remaining substeps, and continue upgrading
          <var>request</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If <var>request</var>'s {{Request/url}}'s {{URL/host}} is the same
          as <var>request</var>'s {{Request/client}}'s origin's {{URL/host}},
          skip the remaining substeps, and continue upgrading
          <var>request</var>.

          Note: We allow only same-origin upgrades in order to ensure that
          navigations between pages of a single site that has opted-into
          the upgrade behavior remain on HTTPS, regardless of the hard-coded
          values in &lt;a&gt; tags. Performing upgrades for navigations to
          third-party resources brings a significantly higher potential for
          breakage, so we're avoiding it for the moment.

          ISSUE: This isn't correct for nested documents. We need to pass the
          policy-setting document's host down to ensure that we're only
          attempting "first-party" upgrades.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return without further modifying <var>request</var>.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Let <var>upgrade state</var> be the result of executing
      [[#should-upgrade-for-client]] upon <var>request</var>'s {{Request/client}}.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <var>upgrade state</var> is <code>No Upgrade</code>, return without
      modifying <var>request</var>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Execute [[#report-an-upgrade]] on <var>request</var>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <var>upgrade state</var> is <code>Monitored Upgrade</code>, return
      without modifying <var>request</var>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <var>request</var>'s {{Request/url}}'s {{URL/scheme}} is
      <code>http</code>, set <var>request</var>'s {{Request/url}}'s
      {{URL/scheme}} to <code>https</code>, and return.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <var>request</var>'s {{Request/url}}s {{URL/port}} is
      <code>80</code>, set <var>request</var>'s {{Request/url}}s {{URL/port}}
      to <code>443</code>.

      Note: This will only change the URL's port if the port is
      explicitly set to <code>80</code>. If the port is not set, or if
      it is set to some non-standard value, the user agent will not
      modify that value. This implementation makes the same tradeoffs as
      HSTS (see [[RFC6797]], and specifically step #5 of
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-8.3">Section
      8.3</a>, and item #6 in
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#appendix-A">Appendix
      A</a>).
    </li>
  </ol>

  Note: Due to Fetch's recursive nature, this algorithm will upgrade
  insecurely-redirected requests as well as insecure initial requests.

  <h3 id="should-upgrade-for-client">
    Should insecure {{Request}}s be upgraded for <var>client</var>?
  </h3>

  Given an {{Request}}'s {{Request/client}} <var>client</var> (an <a>environment
  settings object</a>), this algorithm returns <code>Enforced Upgrade</code> if
  <a><i lang="la">a priori</i> insecure</a> requests associated with that client
  should be upgraded, <code>Monitored Upgrade</code> if requests should be
  reported (via [[#report-an-upgrade]]) but not actually upgraded, and <code>No
  Upgrade</code> otherwise. In short, this will check the client and return the
  appropriate <a>upgrade insecure resource requests flag</a> set on it or its
  <a>browsing context</a>.

  <ol>
    <li>
      If <var>client</var> has a <a>responsible document</a>, return the value
      of its <a>upgrade insecure resource requests flag</a>.

      Note: This catches {{Document}}s or {{Worker}}s whose flag is set directly
      by the <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> directive, or which
      have inherited the flag from an <a>embedding document</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <var>client</var> has a <a>responsible browsing context</a>, return the
      value of its <a>upgrade insecure resource requests flag</a>.

      Note: This catches requests triggered from detached {{Request/client}}s.
      Not sure this is necessary, really, given the inheritance structure
      defined in [[#nesting]].
    </li>
    <li>
      Return <code>No Upgrade</code>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="report-an-upgrade">
    Report an upgrade for <var>request</var>
  </h3>

  When a {{Request}} is upgraded, a CSP violation is triggered with the intent
  of informing authors that resources on their sites will fail to load in
  user agents that do not support this upgrade mechanism.

  Note: This violation report will be triggered for the {{Document}} or
  {{Worker}} that triggers the request. This might or might not be the same
  <a>protected resource</a> that set the
  <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> directive, due to [[#nesting]].
  See [[#violation-report-target]] for detail.

  <ol>
    <li>
      <a>Report a violation</a> for <var>request</var>'s {{Request/client}}'s
      <a>responsible document</a>, using
      <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> as the
      <code>violated-directive</code> and <code>effective-directive</code>,
      and <var>request</var>'s {{Request/url}} as the <code>blocked-uri</code>.

  <h2 id="websockets-integration">Modifications to WebSockets</h2>

  WebSockets do not use the <a>Fetching</a> algorithm, so we need to handle
  those requests separately.

  The <a>establish a WebSocket connection</a> algorithm [[!RFC6455]] is modified
  as follows:

  <ul>
    <li>
      After the current step 1 (and before the new step #2 introduced in
      [[!MIX]]), perform the following step:

      <ol>
        <li>
          If <var>secure</var> is <strong>false</strong>:

          <ol>
            <li>
              Let <var>upgrade state</var> be the result of executing
              [[#should-upgrade-for-client]] upon the
              <a lt="relevant settings object for a script">relevant settings
              object</a> for <var>client</var>'s <var>entry script</var>.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <var>upgrade state</var> is <code>No Upgrade</code>, skip the
              remaining substeps.
            </li>
            <li>
              Execute [[#report-an-upgrade]].
            </li>
            <li>
              If <var>upgrade state</var> is <code>Monitored Upgrade</code>,
              skip the remaining substeps.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set <var>secure</var> to <code>true</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <var>port</var> is <code>80</code>, set <var>port</var> to
              <code>443</code>.

              Note: This will only change the URL's port if the port is
              explicitly set to <code>80</code>. If the port is not set, or if
              it is set to some non-standard value, the user agent will not
              modify that value. This implementation makes the same tradeoffs as
              HSTS (see [[RFC6797]], and specifically step #5 of
              <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-8.3">Section
              8.3</a>, and item #6 in
              <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#appendix-A">Appendix
              A</a>).
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="hsts">Interaction with HSTS</h3>

  The <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> directive does not replace
  the <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> HTTP response header [[RFC6797]].
  Authors who serve their site over secure transport SHOULD send that header
  with an appropriate <code>max-age</code> in order to ensure that users are
  not subject to SSL stripping attacks by maliciously active network attackers.

  <h3 id="violation-report-target">CSP Violation Reports</h3>

  When sending a violation report for an upgraded resource, user agents MUST
  target the {{Document}} or {{Worker}} that triggered the request, rather
  than the {{Document}} or {{Worker}} on which the
  <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> directive was set. Due to
  [[#nesting]], the latter might be a cross-origin ancestor of the former, and
  sending violation reports to that set of reporting endpoints could leak data
  in unexpected ways.

  Likewise, the <code>SecurityPolicyViolationEvent</code> MUST NOT target any
  {{Document}} other than the one which triggered the request, for the same
  reasons.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="authoring">Authoring Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="legacy-clients">Legacy Clients</h3>

  Legacy clients which do support mixed content blocking [[MIX]], but do not
  support the <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> directive will
  continue to have a suboptimal experience on pages which contain
  <a><i lang="la">a priori</i> insecure URLs</a>. Authors SHOULD ensure that
  they collect <a lt="send violation reports">violation reports</a> in order
  to determine which resources are most problematic for their users, and SHOULD
  use that information to prioritize fixes for URLs in legacy content that
  users will most likely request.

  <h3 id="relation-to-hsts">Relation to HSTS</h3>

  The mechanism specified here deals only with the security policy for a
  specific <a>protected resource</a>. It does not deprecate, replace, or in any
  way reduce the value of the <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> HTTP
  response header [[RFC6797]]. Authors can and should continue to use that
  header to ensure that their users are not subject to SSL stripping downgrade
  attacks, as the <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> directive will
  not ensure that users visiting your site via links on third-party sites will
  be upgraded to HTTPS for the top-level navigation.

  Likewise, the <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> header does not imply
  the behavior that <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> activates.
  It only ensures that resources requested from an origin will never hit the
  network insecurely.

  Therefore, we recommend that authors who wish to ensure that their users have
  a secure experience do the following:

  <ol>
    <li>
      Redirect incoming traffic from HTTP to HTTPS by serving a
      <code>Location</code> header along with a <code>302</code> status code.
    </li>
    <li>
      Respond to HTTPS requests with a <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code>
      header with a reasonable <code>max-age</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Work with user agent vendors to add their sites to those user agent's
      HSTS Preload Lists (for example, by visiting
      <a href="https://hstspreload.appspot.com/">hstspreload.appspot.com</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Opt-into either this document's
      <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> mechanism, or into Mixed
      Content's <a>strict mode</a> in order to ensure that insecure content is
      never loaded.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="iana-considerations">IANA Considerations</h2>

  The "HTTP Preferences" registry should be updated with the following
  alteration to the existing registration for the <code><a>return</a></code>
  preference [[!RFC7240]]:

  :  Preference
  :: return

  :  Value
  :: One of "<code>minimal</code>", "<code>representation</code>", or
     "<code><a>secure-representation</a></code>".

  :  Description
  :: When the value is "<code>minimal</code>", it indicates that the client
     prefers that the server return a minimal response to a request.  When the
     value is "<code>representation</code>", it indicates that the client
     prefers that the server include a representation of the current state of
     the resource in response to a request. When the value is
     "<code>secure-representation</code>" it indicates that the client prefers
     to be redirected to a secure version of the resource (and that the client
     supports the <a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a> mechanism).

  :  Reference
  :: <a lt="return">Section 4.2 of RFC7240</a> defines the
     "<code>minimal</code>" and "<code>representation</code>" values. This
     specification (see [[#preference]]) defines the
     <code><a>secure-representation</a></code> value.
